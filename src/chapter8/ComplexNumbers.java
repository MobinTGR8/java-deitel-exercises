/*
8.11 (Complex Numbers) Create a class called Complex for performing arithmetic with complex
numbers. Complex numbers have the form
    realPart + imaginaryPart * i
    where i is sqrt(-1)

Write a program to test your class. Use floating-point variables to represent the private data of the
class. Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when itâ€™s declared.
Provide a no-argument constructor with default values in case no initializers are provided. Provide
public methods that perform the following operations:
a) Add two Complex numbers: The real parts are added together and the imaginary parts are added together.
b) Subtract two Complex numbers: The real part of the right operand is subtracted from the real part of the
left operand, and the imaginary part of the right operand is subtracted from the imaginary part of the left operand.
c) Print Complex numbers in the form (realPart, imaginaryPart).
